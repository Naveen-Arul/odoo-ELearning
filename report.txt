# SkillForge AI - Project Report
Date: 2026-01-29

## Overview
This report summarizes the recent features, bug fixes, and enhancements implemented in the SkillForge AI application.

## 1. AI Interviewer Enhancements
**Goal**: Create a robust, interactive mock interview experience.
- **Target Role Integration**: Users can now select their specific target role (e.g., "Frontend Developer", "Data Scientist"). The AI tailors questions to this role.
- **Dynamic Question Pools**:
    - **Behavioral**: Soft skills, conflict resolution, STAR method.
    - **HR**: Career goals, salary, culture fit.
    - **System Design**: Architecture, scalability (e.g., "Design Twitter").
    - **Technical**: Role-specific questions (React for Frontend, SQL for Data, etc.).
- **Microphone Support**:
    - Implemented `SpeechRecognition` for voice answers.
    - Added "Listening..." visual feedback and pulse animations.
    - Fixed duplication bugs and improved responsiveness with real-time interim results.
- **Anti-Repetition Logic**: The AI now records asked questions and ensures no duplicates in a single session.

## 2. Career Page & Scoring
**Goal**: Provide realistic and motivating career metrics.
- **GitHub Scoring**:
    - Changed to a repository-count based model (Base 40 + 15 * Repos).
    - **AI Relevance**: Added an AI analysis step that compares user projects against the *Target Role*. The final score is the better of the repo-count baseline ONE the AI relevance score.
- **Resume Scoring**:
    - Integrated AI-driven "Role Match Score" to compare resume content vs Target Role requirements.
- **Visual Boosts**:
    - Boosted "Problem Solving" and "Project Experience" metrics in the radar chart to reflect user effort more aggressively.
    - Progress bars now adapt to the theme (White in Dark Mode, Black in Light Mode).

## 3. Dashboard & Roadmaps
**Goal**: Improve navigation and clarity.
- **Completed Roadmaps**:
    - Separated "Active" and "Completed" roadmaps in both Dashboard and Roadmaps Page.
    - Completed roadmaps are moved to a distinct section below active ones.
- **UI Clean-up**:
    - Removed "Hackathons" and "Leaderboard" from the sidebar and routing to focus the MVP.

## 4. Key Files Modified
- **Frontend**:
    - `src/pages/ai/AIInterviewer.js` (Mic, Logic, UI)
    - `src/pages/CareerPage.js` (Scoring, Chart data)
    - `src/pages/Dashboard.js` (Roadmap separation)
    - `src/pages/RoadmapsPage.js` (Roadmap filtering)
- **Backend**:
    - `services/aiService.js` (Question pools, Matching logic)
    - `routes/ai.js` (Role injection)

## 5. Next Steps
- **Production AI**: Replace mock AI responses in `aiService.js` with actual Gemini/OpenAI calls for deeper analysis.
- **Deployment**: Verify all environment variables and build settings.
