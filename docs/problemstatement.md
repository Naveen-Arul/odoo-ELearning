# LearnSphere (eLearning Platform)

Build a responsive eLearning platform with two sides:

1. **Instructor/Admin (Backoffice)**: create and manage courses, lessons, quizzes, attendees, publish courses to the website, and track learner progress.
2. **Learner (Website/App)**: browse/join courses, learn in a full-screen player, attempt quizzes (one question per page), earn points/badges, and post ratings/reviews.

## 1. Objective

Create a complete learning experience where:
- Instructors can build courses made of video/document/image/quiz lessons.
- Learners can start/continue learning, track progress, and complete a course.
- Quizzes support multiple attempts and award points based on the attempt number.
- Learners get badges based on total points.
- Instructors can see course-wise learner progress through reporting.

## 2. Roles

### A) Admin
- Full access to back-office features.
- Can manage courses, reporting, and settings.

### B) Instructor / Course Manager

### Quiz attempts & points

## Why This Hackathon Problem is Important

**Real-world learning workflow:** Shows how a complete learning platform works end-to-end (Course setup → Publish → Enrollment/Access → Learning player → Quiz → Completion → Reviews → Reporting).

**Business logic focus:** Teaches handling real product rules like visibility vs invitation access, progress calculation, attempt-based scoring, points/badges, and reporting accuracy — not just UI screens.

**Industry-ready system thinking:** Builds a production-like solution with role-based permissions, structured content management, downloadable resources control, gamification, and analytics dashboards that reflect actual user behavior.
